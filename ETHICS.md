# Ethics Quick Reference

- No medical advice or dosing guidance; do not encourage illegal activity.
- No promotion: no links, products, or brands in replies.
- Human-in-the-loop: every reply requires explicit human approval; posting is off by default.
- Scheduled scans are read-only; no automated commenting or posting.
- Respect subreddit rules and moderators; comply with Reddit’s Responsible Builder Policy.
- Keep volume low (approval caps, limited scans); avoid spammy behavior.
- Experimental multi-account or humanized browsing scripts are not part of the core workflow and should not be used for automated engagement without explicit approval.
